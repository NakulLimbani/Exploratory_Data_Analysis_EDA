# 🌸 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Iris Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the famous **Iris dataset**, performing statistical analysis and visualizations to understand feature distributions, correlations, and species classification patterns.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Visualize distributions using histograms, boxplots, and pairplots.
- Explore feature relationships using correlation heatmaps and scatter plots.
- Generate insights about the Iris flower dataset.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/NakulLimbani/Exploratory_Data_Analysis_EDA.git
   cd Exploratory_Data_Analysis_EDA/projects/EDA_Iris
   ```
2. Install dependen
   ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run Jupyter Notebook / Python script.

📊 Results & Insights
- Petal length and petal width are the most distinguishing features across species.
- Setosa forms a distinct cluster, while Versicolor and Virginica show partial overlap.
- Feature correlations are strong between petal length and petal width (r ≈ 0.96).

📝 Learnings
- Data cleaning and manipulation with Pandas.
- Visualization and insight generation.
